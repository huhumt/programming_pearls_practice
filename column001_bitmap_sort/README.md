This program is used to implement the column 1 problem in the book of "Programming Pearls".
Problem can be described as below:
  Suppose there is a a.txt file with no more than 10,000,000 items of 7-digit numbers record
  in disorder, and no duplicate numbers. We need to sort the numbers in increse order then
  output it into b.txt. And, only about 1Mb memory can be used with ample disk usage. Expected
  running time of the program is about 10 seconds.
