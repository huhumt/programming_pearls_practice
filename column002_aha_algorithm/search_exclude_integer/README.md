This project is used to solve the first problem in colum 2, ie. "Aha, algorithm".
The problem can be described as below:
    Give a sequential file that contains at most 4,000,000 32-bit integers(to simplify
    the proble, we use unsigned integets here, that is uint32_t type) in random order,
    find a 32-bit integer that isn't in the file. We can use ample quantities of main
    memory. If we can use external "scratch" file with only few hundred bytes of main
    memory, what's the solution?
