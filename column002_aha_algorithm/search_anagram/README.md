This project is used to solve problem 3 at column 2 in the book of "Programming Pearls".
The probem can be described as below:
    Given a dictionary of English words, find all sets of anagrams. For instance, "pots",
    "stop", "tops" are all anagrams of one another because each can be formed by permuting
    the letters of the others. To make things easier, ignore the capitcal letter. It means
    that "stop" and "Stop" and "Tops" are anagrams too.
