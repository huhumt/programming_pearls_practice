This project is used to solve the problem to rotate vector shown
in column 2 of book "Programming Pearls". It can be described as below:
    Rotate a one-dimensional vector of n elements left by i positions.
    For instance, with n=8 and i=3, the vector "abcdefg" is rotated to
    "defghabc". Simple code uses an n-element intermediate vetor to do
    the job in n steps. If only a few dozen of bytes can be used,
    what's the solution?
